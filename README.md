# NLP_Disaster_Tweets_Classification
Twitter is one of the most widely used social media. It also has become an
important communication channel in times of emergency. In this project (Kaggle
competition), we are challenged to build a Machine Learning model that predicts which
tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. We have access to a dataset of
10,000 tweets that were hand classified.
The objective of this project is to figure out whether CNN models with transfer
learning methods can perform well in the traditional NLP task and how well they could
be compared to the "state-of-art" BERT Models.
